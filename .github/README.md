## DUBHUD
A Team Fortress 2 HUD built from the ground up using #base. Forked from budhud, modified by me.

## CHANGES
* Use Futura LT and Helvetica for all HUD elements and health/ammo respectively
* Move ammo and health closer to center of the screen
* Reorder floating bars such as healing targets to be more compact in the middle of the screen
* Remove all flashing, cross, and shadow animations from health/ammo
* Custom loading screen and main menu GIF
